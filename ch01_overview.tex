In the little more than 30 years since computer-based 3D geometric modeling
has been practiced, blah blah blah

\section{Thesis statement, claims and contributions}

Introduce your own approach to the problem in relation to one described, and then
give your thesis statement.

\begin{Thesis}
It is both simple and useful to provide students with a \LaTeX\ template
for their formal thesis proposals.  This results in far fewer
questions from students uncertain as to what belongs in their proposals.  Such a template
will be of benefit to students in Computer Science/Applied Computing as well as to any
others willing and able to use \LaTeX\ for their work.
\end{Thesis}

A formal thesis statement should be a \emph{falsifiable} statement about the goal
you will attempt to achieve with your research project.  For a purely scientific
project, this is the hypothesis you are testing with your research.  For an applied
programming project, it is usually a statement about the feasibility and correctness
of your approach and the advantages it has over other approaches.  For a survey, study,
or library comp, it is usually a statement regarding the need or usefulness of such
a study, its intended audience, and so on.

During my research, I have achieved the following results:
