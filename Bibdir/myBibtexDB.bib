  abstract = {{Stephen Cole Kleene was one of the greatest logicians of the twentieth century
and this book is the influential textbook he wrote to teach the subject to the
next generation. It was first published in 1952, some twenty years after the
publication of G\"{o}del's paper on the incompleteness of arithmetic, which
marked, if not the beginning of modern logic, at least a turning point after
which  ” nothing was ever the same.” Kleene was an important figure in logic,
and lived a long full life of scholarship and teaching. The 1930s was a time
of creativity and ferment in the subject, when the notion of  ” computable”
moved from the realm of philosophical speculation to the realm of science.
This was accomplished by the work of Kurt G\"{o}de1, Alan Turing, and Alonzo
Church, who gave three apparently different precise definitions of
” computable”. When they all turned out to be equivalent, there was a
collective realization that this was indeed the  ” right notion”. Kleene played
a key role in this process. One could say that he was  ” there at the beginning”
of modern logic. He showed the equivalence of lambda calculus with Turing
machines and with G\"{o}del's recursion equations, and developed the modern
machinery of partial recursive functions. This textbook played an invaluable
part in educating the logicians of the present. It played an important role in
their own logical education.}},

  abstract = {{We explore the thesis that type structure is a syntactic discipline for maintaining levels of abstraction. Traditionally, this view has been formalized algebraically, but the algebraic approach fails to encompass higher-order functions. For this purpose, it is necessary to generalize homomorphic functions to relations; the result is an "abstraction" theorem that is applicable to the typed lambda calculus and various extensions, including user-defined types.

Finally, we consider polymorphic functions, and show that the abstraction theorem captures Strachey's concept of parametric, as opposed to ad hoc, polymorphism.}},
