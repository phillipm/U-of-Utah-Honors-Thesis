A distinction can be drawn between image-analytic shape definition and model-based image
segmentation based on synthetic models.  Stephen Pizer contrasts medial image analysis
(whether by Blum or Voronoi skeleta, cores, core atoms, etc.) with
\emph{reality analysis} via medial models such as statistical m-reps.  The dichotomy may
be likened to Plato's Allegory of the Cave\cite{Plato:360BC}, wherein an unseen ``ideal"
object casts a ``shadow" onto the ``wall" of our perceptions.  A 3D data-set is the shadow
of a real object:  image-analytic techniques treat the shadow as the object of study itself,
while model-based techniques work from \emph{a priori} knowledge based on shape properties
and statistics, trying to fit known attributes of the object to the shadow being cast.
This dichotomy may be expressed as
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
image-analytic & \emph{a posteriori}& \emph{deductive, data-derived} \\
\hline
model-based & \emph{a priori}& \emph{inductive, knowledge-derived}.
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
In terms of medial shape description, this expresses itself as
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
b-rep--to--m-rep & \emph{analytic}& \emph{unstable} \\
\hline
m-rep--to--b-rep & \emph{synthetic}& \emph{stable}.
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The idea thus developed in the work of Pizer and his colleagues in image analysis was to
reverse the medial transform, define objects medially and allow the medial structure
to imply the boundaries~\cite{Pizer99b}.  Further, we chose a discretely-sampled medial
representation rather than a continuous one.  This, in an analytic approach, would be seen
as a geometrically-lossy boundary-to-medial transformation; instead, as a synthetic,
medial-to-boundary transformation, it determines the object boundary to within
a sampling-proportional tolerance.
